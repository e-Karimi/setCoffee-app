SetCoffee is an online shop for ordering coffee.

Currently, I'm working on this project crafted using HTML, CSS, Next.js (for backend and frontend).

Pages e.g., Home, single product, login, about us, admin panel, cart and half of user panel developed.

**CRUD** operation is in place for products, comments, discounts, users, and tickets.

Login and register functionality has been implemented in two ways both password and OTP (one-time password)

Some libraries has been used such as React-Reaflet, React-Select, React-Hook-Form, Recharts, React-hot-toast, Sweet Alert, AOS, Bcryptjs, JSON Web Token, Swiper and so on.

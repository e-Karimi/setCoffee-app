SetCoffee is an online shop for ordering coffee.

Currently, I'm working on this project crafted using HTML, CSS, Next.js (for backend and frontend).

Pages e.g., Home, single product, login, about us, admin panel, cart and half of user panel developed.

CRUD operation is in place for products, comments, discounts, users, and tickets.

Login and register functionality has been implemented in two ways both password and OTP (one-time password)

Some libraries like React-Reaflet, React-Select, React-Hook-Form, Recharts, React-hot-toast, Sweet Alert, AOS, Bcryptjs, JSON Web Token, Swiper and so on has been used.

SetCoffee is an online shop for ordering coffee.

Currently, I'm working on this project crafted using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Next.js (for backend and frontend)**.

**MongoDB** has been considered as a Data base.

Pages e.g., Home, single product, login, about us, admin panel, cart and half of user panel developed.

**CRUD** operation is in place for products, comments, discounts, users, and tickets.

**Login** and **register** functionality have been implemented in two ways both **password** and **OTP** (one-time password)

Some libraries have  been used such as React-Hook-Form, Recharts, React-hot-toast, Sweet Alert, AOS, Bcryptjs, JSON Web Token, Swiper, React-Reaflet, React-Select and so on.
